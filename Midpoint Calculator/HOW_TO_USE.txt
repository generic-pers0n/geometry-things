**** GENERAL USAGE ****
Using this calculator is pretty simple. You need to enter a 2 coordinate points. From there,
the calculator does its little magic.

To run the calculator, no installation is needed. Simply run the binary and there you go! You've
just run the calculator.

Once a calculation finishes, the program will ask you if you want to do another calculation. Type
'y' or 'Y' and hit enter if you want to do another calculation. If you don't want to do another
calculation, type 'n', 'N', or anything else and hit enter to exit the calculator.


**** COMPILING THE CALCULATOR ****
You will need a C++ compiler to compile the program. You will also need make installed

All is simple. You just need to run 'make' on a Mac, Linux, or other UNIX-like system to compile
the calculator.

On Windows, with MinGW installed, you can run the following command, provided that g++ is installed
and named to 'g++':

g++ -o main.exe main.cpp


**** NOTES ON INPUTTING COORDINATE POINTS ****
Note that when inputting coordinate points, DO NOT input them in their regular format: (x,y).
Instead, input them in this format: x y. This is the same thing on what you have to do when
inputting coordinate points in Lines.
